Kevin Van Lierde is a web/dev/UX person, coffee addict (a.o.) and casual philosopher. Supports open-source, boasts general curiosity, and enjoys listening to slightly alternative music (for whatever it's worth).

Part of the webdevelopment community since 2013, he started out as pro bono webdesigner, and has been professionally employed since 2015 for various roles as a UX/front-end IT consultant in Belgium.
At <a href="https://unipartners.be" target="_blank">Unipartners</a> he has worked on projects for <a href="https://www.bnpparibasfortis.be" target="_blank">BNP Paribas Fortis</a>, <a href="https://www.colruytgroup.com" target="_blank">Colruyt Group</a>, and <a href="https://ixor.be" target="_blank">Ixor</a>. Today, he enjoys tackling new challenges for <a href="https://blue-frontend.com" target="_blank">Blue Frontend</a>.

## Webdevelopment
Kevin has worked with multiple technical stacks and flavors, mainly focusing on front-end (HTML, CSS, Javascript), <abbr title="User eXperience">UX</abbr>, and PHP. Amongst others, he got his hands dirty with React.js, Vue.js, mithril.js, and knockout.js application frameworks.

## Open-source
Kevin is always seeking out open-source projects that combine **simplicity** with good **user/ developer experience**, with respect for **web standards**. Over time he has contributed to the following open-source projects by means of raising issues, answering questions, contributing code, or making donations: GetSimpleCMS, mithril.js, Knockout.js, noUiSlider, VLC Media Player and metalsmith.

## Opinions
Kevin values **progressive enhancement** over **graceful degradation**. He is not a fan of CSS-in-JS approaches and _emotional_ attachment to technologies or stacks.
