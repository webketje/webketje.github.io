Kevin Van Lierde is a web/dev/UX person, coffee addict (a.o.) and casual philosopher. Supports open-source, boasts general curiosity, and enjoys listening to slightly alternative music (for whatever it's worth).

Part of the webdevelopment community since 2013, he started out as pro bono webdesigner, and is currently employed for various roles as a UX/front-end IT consultant in Belgium.
At [Unipartners](https://unipartners.be) he has worked on projects for BNP Paribas Fortis, Colruyt Group, and Ixor. 

#### Open-source contributions
Kevin is always seeking out open-source projects that combine **simplicity** with good **user/ developer experience**, with respect for **web standards**. Over time Kevin has contributed to the following open-source projects by means of raising issues, answering questions, contributing plugins, or making donations: GetSimpleCMS, Knockout.js, noUiSlider, VLC Media Player. He is especially keen on projects which aim to be feature-rich while maintaining a simplistic API to get the best developer experience. Good examples are mithril.js and metalsmith.io, as well as the aforementioned.
