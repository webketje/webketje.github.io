The project people report the <strong>estimates</strong> to the client and elevate the status of these inaccurate <strong>estimates</strong> to that of commitments.\n\nThen, before the \"sprint\", we review our initial <strong>estimates</strong> *ahum commitments* in greater (technical) detail. Because there are still a lot of unknowns, we tend to estimate more buffer here (back-end is often not ready, always ping-pong between project people and dev-team about unclear specs, more work than originally expected, and often late modifications to the original spec).\n\nWhen an estimate becomes more than 50% extra time at the \"refinement\", we are told: \"sorry, we gotta do it in less\" and when it doesn't work out, we're kindly asked to spend part of our weekend catching up at 100% pay rate (legally it's 150-200%).\n\nFUCK THIS SHIT\n\n*quotes used abundantly because these terms belong to \"agile/scrum\" terminology but we're only pretending",

There was an agreement that deliverables were not to have extensive documentation and unit testing will only cover 30% of each use case (I know, stfu), but that's gone so I have to do the whole thing. I estimated 160 hours coding time, 40% of that for docs and 50 for testing. I'm standing by it.\n\nAll that stuff aside, what bothers me the most about estimates is that there's lazy motherfuckers who say shit like \"I can have their RESTful ws in 2 days, but I said a month, because fuck it\" and generate a win-win situation for them and their company, because the client - practically everytime - will just argue for the task to be completed in barely 10% less of the estimated time, accept the proposal and be happy waiting, the developer will fucking dawdle and the company will be paid for more hours than it deserves.

I lived in a very small room at my mom’s flat, she wanted me out as soon as i turn 18. At the time my plan was to work on freelancer stuff and make my own games. “It will be fine, fuck school, who needs school? 😂“ I haven’t really finished anything back then, so i only had a few wip hobby projects to show ppl as my references. I saw a freelancer job posting. The task was to make a simple quiz game for mobile, it paid 350$. Back then that was a lot of money for me so i took it. I met the client, he said “2-3 week tops, i send you everything, you do the code” Cool. I finally had a “job”😃. The 2-3 weeks turned into a 8 month blur of all-nighting and just implement one more thing and its finished. I did not really have any experience on how to deal with clients and i really needed this project to finally have something on my porfolio. I motivated myself with “if i can finish this i can finish anything”. I think the story of my most definitive all-nighting was 3 months into the development. I finally got everything from the client so it was like just put it together and its done. The client wanted 300 levels, beeing a noob i was i started making all the 300 unity scenes by hand, aligning the pictures, the ui, testing each level, making adjustments to the code, etc.. after a really long night and a fuckton of caffeine i was done. I sent it to the client at around 9 am and gone to sleep. When i woke up i checked my emails to saw this: Cool! But can we do hints? (wich needed a fuckton of rework of my code) I think i had my first mental breakdown while working on the project. After that he wanted more modifications and because i made every level by hand i had to remake all of them like 10 times 😂\nBut in the end it turned out positive, he really helped me to start my carrier, we became sord of friends and the project gave me a lot of confidence and experience on how to deal with stuff when shit goes wrong because everything that can go wrong in a project gone wrong. It was the most valuable developer lesson. Plus it sounds so cool to say “i was born in development hell, b*tch!”🕶\nI attached a pic of the laptop i worked on 😂\nThanks for reading 😃",

I'm running out of cash and I use my credit card for all my transportation costs because the office is too far.\n\n2. I had to have food delivered and paid using my credit card because I  have little cash for the next two weeks. I think I'll have to cash out some of my bitcoins.\n\n3. My condo unit is totally fucked after three years of habitation. The toilet fill valve is broken so my water bills skyrocketed to an insane amount. The kitchen sink is still leaking and so is the bathroom ceiling. I was sleeping when I heard a loud \"tud\" from the bathroom. It's no longer liquid that fell from the ceiling, it's bricks! I didn't notice it until the morning and now my toilet is clogged with broken bricks. It's been five months since I started following up on the repairs and nothing is fixed yet. Now I don't even have money for repairs.\n\n4. My brother brought a big, weird, and ugly drawer over a year ago when they visited so they can keep clothes and shit in there when they stayed with me for a few months. Now it's still there and I can't setup my own workstation because the ugly motherfucker occupies so much space. I have barely recovered from the plastic neon green plates and cups they left before. They pretty much turned my unit into a junkyard.\n\nLife doesn't immediately get better as soon as depression stops. You have to first deal with the aftermath. I'm gonna deal with all this shit as soon as I get my first paycheck. In a weird way, I'm still positive about the future.",

He wanted nothing to do with looking at or approve mock ups or designs so I just did my thing and took care of it. Once I was finished I showed him what I had and said “now I just need some content from you all so I can replace all the placeholder text and images”.\nHe seemed completely onboard. Took down notes of all the content needed, assigned all of it out to his artists to gather what I needed and provide it to me.\nAfter 6 months, and several emails asking if they ever got that content together I finally get a response:\n“LOOK MAN, if you didn’t want to do the site then you shouldn’t have accepted the money. I know you don’t need all these from us to finish up, you’re just stalling! I need the site up now!”\nSo I’m like “Sure man, I’ll publish it exactly as it stands now.”\nAn hour later I get a call “who are these people in these pictures? Why do you have our pricing all wrong? Why is everything in French or something (Lorem ipsum)? I just need my money back at this point.”\nI explained that he’s not getting his money back because I already did my part, but just because it’s important to me that a client is satisfied (and seemingly what he wants is money) I can waive his hosting fee for the next 3 years.\nIt’s been a year now. Sites still up in all “French”, wrong pricing, random stock photos. Couple weeks ago he called to apologize for being a dick before.\nStill haven’t gotten any content to finish up.\nI don’t understand. It’s like these people think if you want to publish a book for instance that you just give the publisher the title you came up with and they’ll fill in the pages with story/info for you.\nI’m a web developer, not a content manager.",

If you plan to work in corporate environments you probably need one of those. Eg. The company I work for right now uses a VPN for homeworking but it simply doesn't support Linux. Also some hardware features (keyboard FN keys using Windows WMI interface, fingerprint scan) have bad support on Linux.\n\nSo.. if I had to do it over, I'd probaby just have a Windows pc with a lot of storage, repartition & dual-boot it anyway",
