She was different than other strangers I have seen that I thought she was stupid. The main reason is i thought she was \"stupid\" to invite me to chat on telegram just after few days. \n\nThe way she chatted, it felt like she had no guard on. Usually, a girl on internet would be drowned with guys wanting to chat and they would be quite hostile or unfriendly and it almost never happens for a real girl to invite guys. The reason she added me was to practice her english while she was preparing to get in uni. As I had nothing to lose, I was okay. \n\nWe chatted a lot. It was weird because the chat we have felt like we knew each other her in real life. She was chatting to me almost every single day. She would send mirror selfies of her when going out, video of food she was prepping, the food she was about to have, photos she took and all. It was odd because she is a hijabi from an muslim majority nation. At one point, I suspected she was looking for attention and interaction from guys. But apparently even her mom knows about me.\n\nFor me, it didn't really matter what her motives were because her chats were helping me cure my feeling of loneliness. We never run out of things to talk about. We had a few little fights along the way, but it felt the friendship became more real after we fix them each time. \n\nToday she is a student in uni learning language to be a teacher, she is my dj where we listen to music together online, she is like my personal therapist where I can rant about things I don't want to rant with people in real life.

He wanted a website for the hotel with booking facility. The budget was plenty for that requirement and I was okay. In my calculations 20% of the proposed budget seemed fair to charge.\n\nFew months in, it turns out he now wants a hotel booking platform where other hotels can also be listed. The reasoning was he wants to avoid the commissions charged by popular booking sites and also feature his own hotel in the booking platform that was about to be build.\n\nI was skeptical about his intentions and my skills in developing it. I was also concerned whether he understood the responsibilities and overhead costs of running such a platform. He talked like it'll be fine. I calculated my billing to about 50% of the budget. I left the other 50% intentionally because I knew it would need for keeping up the site.\n\nTime goes by, i am now 90% into completion of the new requirement. \n\nFew weeks ago, i had informed about server pricing and I quoted a starting price of $15 per month. He seemed quite shocked. His reaction shocked me too and I got concerned whether I would even get rest of the payment ( already got 10% of proposed budget ) as advance.\n\nJust few days ago, he now has a new requirement. He wants to show the hotel pricing from the booking site in Google Maps search. I tried to understand him that those are Ads and I was pretty sure price of running those ads are beyond his budget and probably negate any savings he is trying to make by competing popular booking platforms. Signing up for Hotel Ads as a booking platform is quite challenging. I don't think it'll happen.\n\nI am now concerned he might bail on the project, so I have not informed yet. I just hope I get paid for the work I done and I'll inform then. :P\n\nAnyways, the journey of it's development was quite insightful and challenging experience. I fell in love with a language I knew existed but never really bothered about and a framework whose only thing I knew was that it's name sounded cool to say.","score":11,"created_time":1546602274,"attached_image":"","num_comments":5,"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":1,"user_id":232103,"user_username":"HoloDreamer","user_score":6389,"tags":["rant","mistakes
