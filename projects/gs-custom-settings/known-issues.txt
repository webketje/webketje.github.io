  - Settings import only works with IE10 &amp; up, provide fallback
  - When repeatedly batch editing settings, selection might bug or actions might not be executed on entire selection
  - Repeatedly importing settings for the same tab without reloading the page/ importing settings for another tab first doesn't work
