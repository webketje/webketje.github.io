###Beware of Wordpress 'Multi' themes
###The history of shortcodes in a nutshell
Shortcodes - [short] [codes]
Enter WP Bakery Visual Composer
Most plugin authors define their shortcodes as delimited like so: (% shortcode %).
That being said, I don't understand what's so great about shortcodes, unless they are used to output a really complex piece of code (eg. a JS-enabled gallery, a signup form, a popup). Wordpress is probably the best example of shortcode abuse. I mean I don't see how (% youtube: myvideo %) is so much easier than going to youtube and copy pasting the embed code in GS source view.
