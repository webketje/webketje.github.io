Statements about Javascript frameworks and libraries in this text should be interpreted as true only at the time of writing. Success is in the biggest part defined by popularity. And popularity here is defined as the **adoption of the product in economic activities**.

Multiple factors affect popularity, in the case of Javascript MVC/MVVM frameworks:

- Whether the framework is backed by an established company
- Whether the framework is backed by real-world examples
- The coverage and news stories in popular feeds and platforms
- Which types of production the framework is suitable for
- How well the framework integrates with existing patterns used by developers

There is another circular and vicious condition for popularity: **market demand**. <br>It is **circular** because, depending on the previous factors, a framework will gain or lose popularity, which determines market demand. Developers seeking to learn a new MVC/MVVM framework will in turn look at market demand and choose the framework that provides them with the best job opportunities (agreed,  niches or spare-time projects are an exception to this rule). Similar patterns exist in other technological sectors: Adobe's CS graphic software has a quasi-monopoly over the market although open-source alternatives like [Gimp](), [Inkscape]() and [Scribus]() have arguably achieved a similar level.<br>It is **vicious** because market demand (see [markets and concentration](https://books.google.be/books?id=x-wP_CFGWC8C&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=market+tendency+to+concentration&source=bl&ots=KvAG07N181&sig=uBtLTFfo0DpuVlUMuB5jqlcxA_Q&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=market%20tendency%20to%20concentration&f=false))

What we see in JS frameworks is 3 tiers of frameworks:
