At [Happeningo](http://happeningo.com), I was tasked with creating an infographic featuring a custom history of ten 'happenings' that marked an important moment in the evolution of live content. It was a tougher, but also more enjoyable and creative process than those of the infographics I had created before at [Cleverwood](http://cleverwood.be). I was given no directions to complete the initial mockup, but that it was to be a timeline. This is an account of the design phases the project went through.

### Mind the colors
In the first mockup, I chose dark gray-blue and maroon as colors for the infographic, I applied a sepia filter to all images (they had to be more or less similar in appearance) and surrounded them with a thin white border and maroon padding. I decided the graphic was to be in a somewhat retro style, and used a high-res parchment image as background. Stick a title to the top, an intro underneath, and a logo at the bottom, done! 
*"But can't we use the agency's color to replace the maroon?"* Reluctant to do so because I was confident in my ability to choose the right color from the first time, I nevertheless produced another version and was surprised to find it almost as pretty. There was less contrast, but then again, the goal of the graphic wasn't to introduce a very bold statement.

**TIP**
> TIP: Mind the design and color scheme *an sich*, but keep at least one or two colors from the company color chart in the infographic

### Conventional or original?
With an overwhelming amount of infographics published on a daily basis, -mainly because their reach is pretty huge compared to other types of posts-, I wanted the design to be non-generic, yet clear. Looking at some examples with non-linear or zigzag flows (circles, pyramids, board games, ...) showed that, no matter how nice the design, a linear flow guaranteed much easier readability.

Later another requirement was added: it had to be possible to crop out each happening and share it individually on social networks, so in the end I went with a simple vertical timeline, albeit nicely styled. Vertical, because it also had to be easily viewable on smartphones.
